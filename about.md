My name is Montalvo Miguelo. I have been online for about 5 years now
of developing websites as a freelancer for people all over the
world. For the first 4 of them I worked almost exclusively on
_WordPress_ platform creating custom _Themes_ and _Plugins_. For the last year I have been
working on _Shopify_ platform customizing and building beautiful
_Stores_.

I'm a _Mac_ & _Arch Linux_ user, my favorite text editor is _Vim_ and my
favorite color schemes are _wombat256mod_ and _smyck_.
